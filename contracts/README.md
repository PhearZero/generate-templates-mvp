# Overview

This directory contains the source code for the sites that are a part of the monorepo.
This allows multiple sites hosted from the same repository and is supported by hosting providers such as Cloudflare/Vercel
The sites in the workspace have access to all 'kits/contracts' in the monorepo and allows mixing and matching of kits and frontends.
